### Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Rust and Cargo**: Install Rust and Cargo on your development machine by following the official Rust installation instructions.
- **SUI Blockchain**: Set up a local instance of the SUI blockchain for development and testing purposes. Refer to the SUI documentation for installation instructions.

#### Build and Deploy

1. Clone the Loyalty Rewards Program repository and navigate to the project directory on your local machine.
2. Compile the smart contract code using move:

   ```
   sui move build
   ```
   
3. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your local SUI blockchain node using the SUI CLI or other deployment tools. Note the contract address and other relevant identifiers for interacting with the deployed contract.

### Usage

#### Creating a Reward

To create a new reward, invoke the `create_reward` function with specified parameters such as points, tier, transferability, event trigger, and duration.

#### Validating a Reward

Validate a reward using the `validate_reward` function, ensuring ownership and confirming the reward's validity.

#### Adding Funds to a Reward

Add SUI coins to a reward's escrow balance using the `add_funds_to_reward` function, restricted to the reward's owner.

#### Redeeming a Reward

Redeem a validated reward by invoking the `redeem_reward` function, transferring escrowed funds to the customer and marking the reward as redeemed.

#### Managing Reward Attributes

Update reward attributes such as points, deadline, expiry, tier, transferability, event trigger, and redemption status using respective update functions.

### Interacting with the Smart Contract

#### Using the SUI CLI

Utilize the SUI CLI to interact with the deployed smart contract, providing function arguments and transaction contexts as required. Monitor transaction outputs and blockchain events to track reward creations, validations, redemptions, and attribute updates.

#### Using Web Interfaces (Optional)

Develop web interfaces or applications that interact with the smart contract using JavaScript libraries such as Web3.js or Ethers.js. Implement user-friendly interfaces for managing customer rewards, tracking reward details, and monitoring reward transactions within the Loyalty Rewards Program platform.

### Conclusion

The Loyalty Rewards Program Smart Contract module provides a robust solution for managing customer rewards in a decentralized environment. By leveraging blockchain technology, businesses can effectively incentivize customer loyalty while ensuring transparency, security, and accountability in reward management processes. This module serves as a foundational component for implementing loyalty programs that drive customer engagement and retention strategies.
